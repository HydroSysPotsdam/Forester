Testing Forester
================

Thank you so much for concidering to test Forester. It would really help a lot!

After reading this you probably want to look at the :ref:`quickstart <Quickstart>` workflow.

The will be a lot of bugs. Some so subtle that we have not noticed them and some painfully obvious that we are sorry you had to see them. We need your help to find them all!

.. admonition:: Reporting a Bug
   :class: help bug

   Please report bugs on our GitHub reposity by creating a `Bug Report Issue <https://github.com/HydroSysPotsdam/Forester/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=>`_. Make sure that the issue is labeled as a :bdg-danger:`bug` and add the label :bdg-danger:`severe` when the bug prevents you from using Forester properly. It would also be very helpful when you check beforehand if the same bug has already been reported.

Where We Need Help

There are multiple aspects that need to be tested. Of course we hope that you will concider all of them but even covering some is tremendously helpful to us. Below we listed what we concider to be important and suggest some questions to ask yourself.

**Installation**

* Have you been able to run Forester on your machine and browser?
* Are there problems with the installation that prevent you from using Forester?

**Your Projects**
